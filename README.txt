SortPhoto
--------------
SortPhoto reads image EXIF metadata and sorts photos into year/month/file trees. It takes two arguments- a source folder and a destination folder.


Why do the months have numbers?

The months have numbers so that when viewed in alphabetical order in a file manager, the months will be in order!

You may download sortphoto from the releases.
